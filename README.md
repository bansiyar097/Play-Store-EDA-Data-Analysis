The aim of this project is to analyze a dataset containing information about mobile apps from the Google Play Store. We will perform various data analysis tasks, including data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization, to derive insights into app categories, ratings, sizes, installations, and other relevant factors.



<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
The main objectives of this project are :-
To gain insights into app categories and their distribution.
To analyze app ratings and identify trends or patterns.
To preprocess and clean the data for further analysis.
To visualize the data using appropriate plots and charts.
To answer specific questions related to app characteristics, ratings, and installations.

<h2>Steps Taken</h2>

**Data Loading**: Loaded the dataset containing information about Google Play Store apps.

**Data Exploration**: Explored the dataset to understand its structure, columns, and values.

**Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data entries.
Converted data types to the appropriate format.

**Data Preprocessing**: Performed transformations and manipulations as required for analysis.
Created new columns and extract relevant information.

**Data Analysis**: Perform various analysis tasks such as category distribution, rating trends, etc.
Answered specific questions based on the analysis objectives.

**Data Visualization**:
Created visualizations using plots and charts to represent the data.
Interpreted the visualizations to derive insights and findings.

**Data Cleaning**:
Handled missing values in columns such as 'Rating', 'Size', 'Installs', etc.
Removed duplicate entries to ensure data integrity.
Converted data types of columns to the appropriate format for analysis.

**Data Preprocessing**:
Converted 'Size' column values from KB to MB.
Converted 'Installs' column values to numeric form.
Added a new column 'Least Android Version' by extracting numerical values from the 'Android Ver' column.
